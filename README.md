Swarms, formations, and teams of collaborating entities have many advantages over complex single system entities performing the same function. Deploying multiple small robots rather than a more complex unit to perform certain actions can decrease overall cost and increase the flexibility and robustness of the entire system. For example, a formation of quadcopter drones could be deployed in a search and rescue environment to locate a target. Two current challenges facing collaborating entities are communications between units and autonomy. This research lays the foundation of _understanding_ a novel trilateration technique for locating a target using a formation of three drones without direction finders or traditional triangulation methods. The two dimensional concept is proven here in simulation using MATLAB. Then, the concept is demonstrated in a field test with Raspberry Pi computers communicating over XBee dongles. This manual SCADA system can be improved further by implementing quadcopters to quickly and autonomously locate a target.
